# Power-BI-project-Local-Councils-financial-status _as of Jan 2024_

English Councils, as of January 2024, are coming under scrutiny due to their debt totals, fuelled partly by taking on risky loans to make up for funding gaps due to austerity, straining their capabilities to provide local services.
This project takes the Local Councils of England, determines their financial status - bankrupt, in financial risk, or neither - and maps them to create an interactive dashboard.

- I used the 2023 map boundaries provided by the UK's Open Geography Portal - https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/2f0b8074b6ab4af6a1ec30eb66317d12_0/explore.
- Used QGIS to transform the map to be smaller in size.
- Finally, using _mapshaper_ to convert this smaller map file into TopoJSON, to be compatible with Power BI
